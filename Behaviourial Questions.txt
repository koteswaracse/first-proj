1. The Biggest Mistake you made and what did you learn from it?
When i worked in Starbucks project, we had 6 people in the team. It was kind support and enhancement project. Support activity means, deliver the sales data by 6:00PM daily without any delay. Every week, one person has to do the support and another one perosn will be backup of him. I  was the primary support person on that week. Due to unaviodable office meeting, i asked the back-up person to take care of the loads and went to meeting. Unfortunately one of the job was failed and not take care of one hour. When i came to desk and saw the job, the loads are aborted due to delay of this job. Immediately coordinate the stake holder and sent mail to Business prople on delay loads. Then fixed the issue and load the data with delay of 2 hours. As a primary support person, i took the responsibility and sent the explaination and apology mail to stake holders and client as well.
Bottomline: Whenever you are taking some responsibilities, we need to fulfill our job with out any delay or not assigned to someone. Documented the same and put the confluence for remind purpose.
